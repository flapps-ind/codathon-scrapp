### A Hyper‑Local AI‑Powered Reuse Marketplace

Scrapp is a **desktop‑first, responsive web application** built during a **4‑hour hackathon** to reduce waste by enabling instant reuse of items before they reach landfills.

It works like a **“Olx for Trash”** — users post items they are about to discard, and nearby users can claim them for reuse.
